# Overview

This dataset contains 2986 images and 3448 labels across a single annotation class: pistols. Images are wide-ranging: pistols in-hand, cartoons, and staged studio quality images of guns.

The dataset was originally released by the [University of Grenada ](https://sci2s.ugr.es/weapons-detection#RP), duplicates removed, and rehosted by a Roboflow user.

# Use Cases
One can create a gun object detection model to monitor security camera footage for the presence of guns, perhaps in places where they should not be. Alaa Senjab [built on Roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.ai/eliminating-boilerplate-code-with-roboflow-to-monitor-security-footage/) to achieve this goal. He's also open sourced much of his work in [this tutorial ](https://towardsdatascience.com/detailed-tutorial-build-your-custom-real-time-object-detector-5ade1017fd2d).
